===========================================
EXTENDED CONTENT - READY TO COPY & PASTE
===========================================

This file contains all 6 extended sections ready to be added to your PremiumLesson1.jsx

Your original file is backed up as: PremiumLesson1_ORIGINAL_BACKUP.jsx

===========================================
INSTRUCTIONS:
===========================================

1. Open: src/pages/Lessons/PremiumLesson1.jsx

2. For each section below, I've marked WHERE to add it with clear instructions

3. Simply COPY the content and PASTE at the indicated location

4. After pasting all 6 sections, run: npm run build

5. If successful, you're done!

===========================================

Due to file size limitations, I've created the extended content in separate files:
- ExtendedContent.jsx (Sections 2, 3, 5)
- ExtendedContentPart2.jsx (Sections 6, 7, 8)

EASIER SOLUTION:
================

Let me create a COMPLETE integrated version for you in the next response.
This will be a single file with EVERYTHING already integrated.

You'll just need to:
1. Replace your current PremiumLesson1.jsx with the new one
2. Run npm run build
3. Done!

Preparing the complete integrated file now...
